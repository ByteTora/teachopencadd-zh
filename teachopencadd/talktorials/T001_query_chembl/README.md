__Talktorial T001__: This talktorial is part of the TeachOpenCADD pipeline described in the [first TeachOpenCADD paper](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-019-0351-x), comprising of talktorials T001-T010.


## Aim of this talktorial

In this notebook, we will learn more about the ChEMBL database and how to extract data from ChEMBL, i.e. (compound, activity data) pairs for a target of interest. These data sets can be used for many cheminformatics tasks, such as similarity search, clustering or machine learning.

Our work here will include finding compounds that were tested against a certain target and filtering available bioactivity data.


### Contents in *Theory*

* ChEMBL database
    * ChEMBL web services
    * ChEMBL web resource client
* Compound activity measures
    * IC50 measure
    * pIC50 value


### Contents in *Practical*
    
**Goal: Get a list of compounds with bioactivity data for a given target**

* Connect to ChEMBL database
* Get target data (example: EGFR kinase)
    * Fetch and download target data
    * Select target ChEMBL ID
* Get bioactivity data
    * Fetch and download bioactivity data for targets
    * Preprocess and filter bioactivity data
* Get compound data
    * Fetch and download compound data
    * Preprocess and filter compound data
* Output bioactivity-compound data
    * Merge bioactivity and compound data, and add pIC50 values
    * Draw molecules with highest pIC50
    * Freeze bioactivity data to ChEMBL 27
    * Write output file
