## Aim of this talktorial

The goal of this talktorial is to introduce the reader to the field of protein-ligand interaction prediction using graph neural networks (GNNs). GNNs are especially useful for representing structural data such as proteins and chemical molecules (ligands) to a deep learning model. In this talktorial, we will show how to train a deep learning model to predict interactions between proteins and ligands.
